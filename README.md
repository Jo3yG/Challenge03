# Challenge03
JavaScript
# Description
This Challenge03 was about learning how to utilize JavaScript to create a password generator, the criteria included was the password must contain between 8-128 characters, one of the following; uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters, and then the coded needed to verify that the criteria was met and the password would generate a random password...hopefully.
# Issues
I was having issues with the first code i thought of, i even left the code (commented of course) so you can see the route i was trying to accomplish,until i did a little mire research and decided to have the password start with an index of 0 then a random character be added to the end of the password as long as the password being created was shorter than the total number of characters that was chosen in the beggining.
# Code
The code was pretty much started from scratch and I had to figure out the correct formula. The first code i was going for was really long and i believe what was eventually keeoing me from completing that way was i probably didnt have brackets in the right area, but the 2nd iteration of my code my issue was naming structure and how i had different names everywhere even though i wanted to use the same var.
